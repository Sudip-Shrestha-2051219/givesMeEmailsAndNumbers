# givesMeEmailsAndNumbers
This is just a simple demonstration of automation from the book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. In this example we copy a large amount of words into the clipboard and then we run the python script which should then give us all the emails and phone numbers present in that copied group of text. Further regex matching is yet to be performed.
