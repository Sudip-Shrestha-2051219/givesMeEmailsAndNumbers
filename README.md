# givesMeEmailsAndNumbers
This is just a simple demonstration of automation from the book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. In this example we copy a large amount of words into the clipboard and then we run the python script which should then give us all the lists of emails and phone numbers present in that group and paste them in the clipboard as well. The examples emails are (   sdfs@gmail.com   dfsf3242%_@exa.edu   sfa-+%242@rek.gov  and so on.) and the examples of phone numbers matched are (   243-234-2342   223-2342 and so on.)
